Fundamental ratios vary in what's considered "good" depending on the industry, market conditions, and specific
investment goals. However, here are some general guidelines for a few key fundamental ratios:
<br>

1. **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio**:
<br>
- **General Range**: 10-20 is often considered reasonable.
<br>
- **Low P/E**: May indicate undervaluation, but could also suggest issues with the company.
<br>
- **High P/E**: May indicate overvaluation or high growth expectations.
<br>

2. **Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio**:
<br>

- **General Range**: Below 3 is often considered good.
<br>

- **Low P/B**: May indicate undervaluation.
<br>

- **High P/B**: Could suggest overvaluation, especially if above 3-5.
<br>

3. **Return on Equity (ROE)**:
<br>
- **General Range**: 15% or higher is considered strong.
<br>
- **Low ROE**: May indicate poor profitability or inefficient management.
<br>
- **High ROE**: Suggests efficient use of equity to generate profits.
<br>

4. **Debt-to-Equity (D/E) Ratio**:
<br>
- **High D/E**: Indicates higher financial risk, as the company relies more on debt.
<br>

5. **Current Ratio**:
<br>
- **General Range**: Between 1.5 and 2 is often seen as healthy.
<br>
- **Low Current Ratio**: May suggest liquidity issues.
<br>
- **High Current Ratio**: Might indicate excess cash or inefficient use of resources.
<br>

6. **Net Profit Margin**:
- **General Range**: 10% or higher is usually strong.
- **Low Margin**: May suggest operational inefficiencies.
- **High Margin**: Indicates strong profitability.
<br>

7. **Earnings Growth Rate**:
<br>
- **General Range**: 10% or higher is generally attractive.
<br>
- **Low Growth**: May indicate a mature or struggling company.
<br>
- **High Growth**: Suggests strong future potential.
<br>

8. **Dividend Yield**:
<br>
- **General Range**: 2-5% is often attractive, depending on the industry.
<br>
- **Low Yield**: May indicate overvaluation or reinvestment in growth.
<br>
- **High Yield**: Could signal a mature company or potential financial issues.
<br>

9. **Operating Margin**:
<br>
- **General Range**: 15% or higher is typically good.
<br>
- **Low Operating Margin**: May indicate cost management issues.
<br>
- **High Operating Margin**: Suggests strong control over costs.
<br>

10. **Free Cash Flow (FCF)**:
<br>
- **Positive and Growing**: Indicates good cash generation and financial health.
<br>
- **Negative FCF**: May signal cash flow issues or high capital expenditure.
<br>

These ranges are general and can vary widely depending on the sector and economic environment. It's also important to
compare these ratios to industry peers for a more accurate assessment.
