 Fundamental ratios vary in what's considered "good" depending on the industry, market conditions, and specific investment goals. However, here are some general guidelines for a few key fundamental ratios:

1. **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio**:
   - **General Range**: 10-20 is often considered reasonable.
   - **Low P/E**: May indicate undervaluation, but could also suggest issues with the company.
   - **High P/E**: May indicate overvaluation or high growth expectations.

2. **Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio**:
   - **General Range**: Below 3 is often considered good.
   - **Low P/B**: May indicate undervaluation.
   - **High P/B**: Could suggest overvaluation, especially if above 3-5.

3. **Return on Equity (ROE)**:
   - **General Range**: 15% or higher is considered strong.
   - **Low ROE**: May indicate poor profitability or inefficient management.
   - **High ROE**: Suggests efficient use of equity to generate profits.

4. **Debt-to-Equity (D/E) Ratio**:
   - **General Range**: Below 1 is often considered healthy.
   - **High D/E**: Indicates higher financial risk, as the company relies more on debt.

5. **Current Ratio**:
   - **General Range**: Between 1.5 and 2 is often seen as healthy.
   - **Low Current Ratio**: May suggest liquidity issues.
   - **High Current Ratio**: Might indicate excess cash or inefficient use of resources.

   - **Low Growth**: May indicate a mature or struggling company.
   - **High Growth**: Suggests strong future potential.

8. **Dividend Yield**:
   - **General Range**: 2-5% is often attractive, depending on the industry.
   - **Low Yield**: May indicate overvaluation or reinvestment in growth.
   - **High Yield**: Could signal a mature company or potential financial issues.

9. **Operating Margin**:
   - **General Range**: 15% or higher is typically good.
   - **Low Operating Margin**: May indicate cost management issues.
   - **High Operating Margin**: Suggests strong control over costs.

10. **Free Cash Flow (FCF)**:
    - **Positive and Growing**: Indicates good cash generation and financial health.
