## Basic Terminology

### 1. Stock Name & Symbol
Every stock has two key identifiers:

- **Company Name**: The full legal name of the company
  - Example: "Bharti Airtel Limited"
- **Stock Symbol/Ticker**: Short alphabetic code for trading
  - Example: BHARTIARTL (NSE), 532454 (BSE)

### 2. Market Capitalization

**Formula**: `Market Cap = Current Market Price × Total Number of Shares`

**Example - Bharti Airtel**:
- Current Price: ₹928
- Market Cap: ₹11,02,600 crores
- Total Shares Outstanding: ~571.8 crore shares

#### Market Cap Categories:
- **Large Cap**: > ₹20,000 crores
- **Mid Cap**: ₹5,000 - ₹20,000 crores  
- **Small Cap**: < ₹5,000 crores

### 3. Shareholding Pattern

Stock ownership is distributed among different categories:

| Category | Description | Typical % |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Promoters** | Original founders/owners | 40-75% |
| **FII** | Foreign Institutional Investors | 15-30% |
| **DII** | Domestic Institutional Investors | 10-25% |
| **Government** | Government holdings | 0-5% |
| **Public** | Retail investors (like us) | 2-15% |

**Example - Bharti Airtel Shareholding**:
- Promoters: 52.42%
- FII: 25.4%
- DII: 19.36%
- Public: 2.85%
- Total Shareholders: 8,42,428

- Total listed companies: ~7,500

### 2. Market Movements

- **Definition**: Rising market prices
- **Color**: Green
- **Characteristics**: Optimism, increased buying

#### Bear Market 📉
- **Definition**: Falling market prices  
- **Color**: Red

---

## Stock Analysis & Ratios

### 1. Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio

**Formula**: `P/E = Current Market Price ÷ Earnings Per Share (EPS)`

**Example - Reliance Industries**:
- Current Price: ₹1,425
- EPS: ₹71.4 (annual)
- P/E Ratio: 20x

#### P/E Interpretation:
- **High P/E**: Future growth expectations, possibly overvalued
- **Low P/E**: Undervalued or poor growth prospects

#### Comparison Framework:
Compare company P/E with:
1. **Historical Average P/E** of the same company
2. **Industry P/E** average
3. **Market P/E** (Nifty/Sensex P/E)

### 2. Operating Profit Margin (OPM)

**Formula**: `OPM = Operating Profit ÷ Revenue × 100`

**Importance**:
- Shows core business efficiency
- Higher OPM = Better cost control and pricing power
- Should be consistently increasing quarter over quarter

**What to Look For**:
- Q1 < Q2 < Q3 < Q4 (increasing trend)
- Year-on-year improvement
- Compare with industry standards

**Example Pattern**: 
- If Q1 = 14%, Q2 = 17%, Q3 = 18%, Q4 = 20% → Excellent sign

### 3. Return on Equity (ROE)

**Formula**: `ROE = Net Income ÷ Shareholders' Equity × 100`

**Significance**:
- Measures management efficiency
- Shows how well company uses shareholders' money
- Should consistently improve over time

### 4. Financial Results Analysis

Key metrics to track in quarterly results:

| Metric | Description | Example (TCS Q1) |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| **Revenue** | Total sales | ₹63,070 crores |
| **Operating Expenses** | Salaries, costs | ₹46,000 crores |
| **Operating Profit** | Revenue - Expenses | ₹16,000 crores |
| **Net Profit** | Final profit after tax | ₹12,800 crores |
| **Operating Margin** | Operating Profit/Revenue | 25.4% |

---

## Cash Flow Analysis

### Understanding Three Types of Cash Flows

#### 1. Operating Cash Flow (OCF)
- **What it shows**: Money from core business operations
- **Formula**: Collections from customers - Payments to suppliers & employees
- **Good sign**: Positive and increasing
- **Warning**: Negative OCF consistently

#### 2. Investing Cash Flow (ICF)
- **What it shows**: Money spent/received from investments
- **Includes**: Buying/selling assets, acquiring companies, CAPEX
- **Good sign**: Generally negative (company investing for growth)
- **Formula**: Asset sales - Asset purchases - CAPEX

#### 3. Financing Cash Flow (FCF)
- **What it shows**: Money flow from financing activities
- **Includes**: Taking loans, issuing shares, paying dividends, buybacks
- **Interpretation**:
  - **Positive**: Raising money (loans/equity)
  - **Negative**: Paying dividends, buying back shares

### Key Cash Flow Insights

**Critical Rule**: 
> "Cash rarely lies, but accounting can be manipulated"

**Free Cash Flow**: `Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditure`

**Why FCF matters**:
- Shows real money left after business operations
- Can be used for debt payment, dividends, or growth
- More reliable than reported profits

### Cash Flow per Share

**Formula**: `Cash Flow per Share = Operating Cash Flow ÷ Total Shares`

**Importance**: More reliable than EPS for valuation

**Warren Buffett's Rule**:
> Operating Cash Flow ÷ Net Income should be > 1
> If consistently < 1 → Doubt the earnings quality

---

## Advanced Valuation Metrics

### 1. PEG Ratio (Price/Earnings to Growth)

**Formula**: `PEG = P/E Ratio ÷ Earnings Growth Rate`

**Example Calculation**:
- Stock A: P/E = 20, Growth = 10% → PEG = 2.0
- Stock B: P/E = 30, Growth = 20% → PEG = 1.5
- **Conclusion**: Stock B is better value despite higher P/E

**Interpretation**:
- **PEG < 1**: Undervalued (excellent opportunity)
- **PEG = 1**: Fair value
- **PEG > 1**: Overvalued (proceed with caution)

**Real Examples**:
- Reliance: PEG = 4.62 (Overvalued - that's why it fell)
- HDFC Bank: PEG = 0.91 (Undervalued)
- Zomato: PEG = 33.3 (Highly overvalued)

### 2. Piotroski F-Score

**Created by**: Stanford University Professor Joseph Piotroski

**Scoring System**: 0 to 9 points based on 9 financial criteria

#### Four Profitability Points:
1. **Positive Net Income** → 1 point
2. **Positive Operating Cash Flow** → 1 point  
3. **Improving ROE** → 1 point
4. **OCF > Net Income** → 1 point

#### Three Leverage & Liquidity Points:
1. **Decreasing Debt** → 1 point
2. **Improving Current Ratio** → 1 point
3. **No Equity Dilution** → 1 point

#### Two Operating Efficiency Points:
1. **Improving Gross Margin** → 1 point
2. **Improving Asset Turnover** → 1 point

**Score Interpretation**:
- **0-4**: Avoid (Poor quality)
- **5-7**: Good (Decent quality)
- **8-9**: Excellent (High quality)

**Examples**:
- Swiggy: Score = 4 (Avoid - lost 50% after IPO)
- Infosys: Score = 6 (Good)
- SBI: Score = 7 (Good)

### 3. Altman Z-Score

**Purpose**: Predicts bankruptcy risk

**Score Ranges**:
- **< 1.81**: High bankruptcy risk (Danger zone - Red)
- **1.81 - 2.99**: Medium risk (Gray zone - Watch closely)
- **> 2.99**: Safe (Green zone)

**Note**: Don't use for Banks and NBFCs

**Examples**:
- Mahindra & Mahindra: 3.98 (Very Safe)
- Finolex Cables: 7.72 (Excellent)
- Solar Industries: 8+ (Top quality)

### 4. G-Factor

**Purpose**: Compare companies within the same sector

**Application**: 
- Use for sector-wise comparison
- Higher G-Factor = Better positioned in industry
- Combine with other metrics for complete analysis

## Investment Strategies

### 1. Investment Time Horizons

- **Risk**: Very High
- **Capital Requirement**: Low
