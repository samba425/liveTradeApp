### Example TradingView Script

Here’s a simplified example of how you might set up a script in TradingView to screen for some of these metrics:

```pinescript
//@version=5
indicator("Stock Selection Metrics", overlay=false)

// Inputs
sales = input(1000000, title="Minimum Sales")
pat = input(100000, title="Minimum Profit After Tax")
debtToEquity = input(1, title="Maximum Debt to Equity Ratio")
roe = input(10, title="Minimum Return on Equity (%)")
peRatio = input(20, title="Maximum Price to Earnings Ratio")
currentRatio = input(1.5, title="Minimum Current Ratio")

// Example Data (replace with actual data sources)
companySales = 1500000
companyPAT = 200000
companyDE = 0.8
companyROE = 12
companyPE = 18
companyCurrentRatio = 2

// Conditions
salesCondition = companySales >= sales
patCondition = companyPAT >= pat
debtCondition = companyDE <= debtToEquity
roeCondition = companyROE >= roe
peCondition = companyPE <= peRatio
currentRatioCondition = companyCurrentRatio >= currentRatio

// Combine Conditions
selectionCondition = salesCondition and patCondition and debtCondition and roeCondition and peCondition and currentRatioCondition

// Output
plot(selectionCondition ? 1 : 0, title="Stock Selection", style=plot.style_columns, color=selectionCondition ? color.green : color.red)
```

This script is a simplified example and should be adjusted to use actual data and more comprehensive logic. By combining multiple metrics, you can make a more informed decision about which stocks to consider for investment.
