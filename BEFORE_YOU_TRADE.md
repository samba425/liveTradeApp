## 1️⃣ **Option Greeks** - "The 4 Forces That Move Option Prices"

| Greek | What It Measures | Simple Meaning | Example |
|-------|-----------------|----------------|---------|
| **Delta (Δ)** | Direction sensitivity | How much option price changes when stock moves ₹1 | Delta 0.5 = If Nifty moves ₹100, option moves ₹50 |
| **Theta (Θ)** | Time decay | Money you lose daily (even if market doesn't move) | Theta -50 = You lose ₹50 every day |
| **Vega (V)** | IV sensitivity | How much price changes when IV changes 1% | Vega 15 = If IV rises 1%, you gain ₹15 |
| **Gamma (Γ)** | Delta change rate | How fast delta changes | High Gamma = Delta changes very fast |

### 🎯 **Why This Matters:**
- **Buying Options?** → Watch Theta (time decay kills you!)
- **Near Expiry?** → Watch Gamma (prices swing wildly)
- **Event Trading?** → Watch Vega (IV spike/crush)

## 2️⃣ **ATM vs ITM vs OTM** - "Choose the Right Strike"

| Type | Meaning | Premium Cost | Risk | When to Buy |
|------|---------|--------------|------|-------------|
| **ATM (At The Money)** | Strike = Current Price | Medium | Medium | Best balance - Most traders use this |
| **ITM (In The Money)** | Already profitable | **Expensive** | Low | Conservative, need big capital |
| **OTM (Out The Money)** | Not yet profitable | **Very Cheap** | **Very High** | Lottery ticket - 90% expire worthless |

### 💡 **Beginner Rule:**
✅ **Start with ATM options** - Good balance of risk/reward  
⚠️ **Avoid OTM** - Looks cheap but rarely works  
📊 **Example:** Nifty at 19500  
- ITM Call: 19000 strike (costs ₹600)  
- ATM Call: 19500 strike (costs ₹200) ✅ **BEST**  
- OTM Call: 20000 strike (costs ₹30) ⚠️ **RISKY**

---

## 3️⃣ **Stop Loss & Position Sizing** - "Never Risk More Than You Can Afford"

### 📏 **Golden Rules:**

| Rule | Amount | Why |
|------|--------|-----|
| **Max Risk Per Trade** | 2% of capital | One bad trade won't destroy you |
| **Stop Loss** | 20-30% of premium | Exit before total loss |
| **Max Positions** | 3-5 at a time | Don't over-diversify |

### 🎯 **Real Example:**
- **Your Capital:** ₹100,000
- **Risk Per Trade:** ₹2,000 (2%)
- **Buy Call at:** ₹200
- **Stop Loss at:** ₹140 (30% loss = ₹60)
- **Max Quantity:** ₹2,000 ÷ ₹60 = **33 lots max**

### ⚠️ **Common Mistakes:**
- ❌ "Let me wait, it will recover" → **NO!** Cut losses fast
- ❌ Risking ₹50,000 on one trade → **Disaster waiting to happen**
- ❌ No stop loss → **90% of beginners lose money this way**

---

## 4️⃣ **Expiry Day Trading** - "Thursday = Danger Day"

### 📅 **Weekly Expiry Timeline:**

| Day | What Happens | Strategy |
|-----|--------------|----------|
| **Monday-Tuesday** | Slow premium decay | ✅ Safe to buy options |
| **Wednesday** | Theta increases | ⚠️ Cautious - decay accelerates |
| **Thursday (Expiry)** | **Extreme moves** | 🚫 **Avoid buying** - Only for experts |
| **Friday** | New week starts | ✅ Fresh start |

### 🎯 **Expiry Day Rules:**
1. **Don't buy options on Thursday** → Theta decay is maximum
2. **Close positions by 3:00 PM** → Avoid last 30 mins chaos
3. **Watch for pin risk** → Market often "pins" to max OI strike
4. **Cash settle only** → No physical delivery worry for indices

## 5️⃣ **Lot Size & Margin** - "Know How Much Money You Need"

### 📊 **Current Lot Sizes (2026):**

| Index | Lot Size | Approx. Margin (per lot) | Example |
|-------|----------|-------------------------|---------|
| **Nifty 50** | 50 | ₹100,000 - ₹150,000 | 19500 × 50 = ₹9,75,000 value |
| **Bank Nifty** | 25 | ₹150,000 - ₹200,000 | 44000 × 25 = ₹11,00,000 value |
| **Fin Nifty** | 40 | ₹80,000 - ₹120,000 | Smaller capital |
| **Stocks** | Varies | Check NSE website | Reliance, HDFC, etc. |

### 💰 **Capital Needed (Realistic):**
- **Minimum to start:** ₹50,000 (very tight)
- **Comfortable:** ₹1,00,000 - ₹2,00,000
- **Ideal:** ₹3,00,000+ (can take 2-3 positions safely)

### ⚠️ **Margin Call Warning:**
- If loss exceeds margin → Broker **auto-squares off** your position
- Can happen in minutes during volatile moves
- Always keep extra buffer (20-30% extra cash)

---

## 6️⃣ **Liquidity & Bid-Ask Spread** - "Can You Actually Buy/Sell?"

### 🔍 **Check Before Trading:**

| Check | Good ✅ | Bad ❌ |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **Volume** | > 1000 contracts | < 100 contracts |
| **Bid-Ask Spread** | ₹0.50 - ₹2 | > ₹5 (avoid!) |
| **OI (Open Interest)** | > 50,000 | < 5,000 |

### 🎯 **Why This Matters:**
- **Low liquidity** = Can't exit when you want
- **Wide spread** = You lose money on entry/exit
- **ATM strikes** = Always most liquid
- **Far OTM strikes** = Often illiquid (avoid)

### 💡 **Beginner Tip:**
✅ **Stick to Nifty/BankNifty ATM options** → Always liquid  
❌ **Avoid stock options initially** → Many are illiquid

| **GST** | 18% on brokerage | Adds up |
| **Stamp Duty** | 0.003% | Small but there |
| **SEBI Charges** | ₹10 per crore | Minimal |

### 🎯 **Real Example:**
- **Trade:** Buy BankNifty Call at ₹200, Sell at ₹250
- **Profit (before tax):** ₹50 × 25 = ₹1,250
- **Total charges:** ~₹150-200
- **Net profit:** ₹1,050-1,100

### 📊 **Tax on Profits:**
